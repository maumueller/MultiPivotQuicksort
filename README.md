Source code used in the quicksort experiments of the thesis ``On the Analysis of
Two Randomized Algorithms: Multi-Pivot Quicksort and Efficient Hash Functions''.

Dependencies
------------

Needs g++, cmake in version >= 2.8, libboost-random and libpapi for performance
measurements. (Enabled by default, can be changed in CMakeLists.txt.)
